TODO
- pdf of Newman chapter
- links to other textbooks?
- links to software?
- for sampling / data collection / stats,
  organize in a way that is helpful for project proposals

DAY 1:
* intros
* go over syllabus
* sign up for discussion weeks

* lecture for next week

LECTURES
- overview / defns / etc
  -> based on newman book, maybe other book
- data collection
  -> based on marsden review + that book w/ chapters?
